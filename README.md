#### A simple score and train tracking application compatible with all versions of the popular Ticket to Ride board game.

## Features:
- Able to add any number of players and specify their train color.
- Able to set and track the number of remaining trains per player based on the version of TTR you're playing (Custom version included as well).

- When a TTR version is selected, only the respective route lengths are displayed.
- Able to add/subtract custom values for dynamic scoring.
