        </p>

        <h1 id="management" class="text-primary">Game Management</h1>

        <!-- TRAINS -->
        <h1 id="trains" class="text-primary">Trains</h1>

        <h3>Available Routes</h3>
        <p>
          When you select a user, you will be presented with a list of available routes. These routes are specific to the version of Ticket to Ride you have selected in the <a href="#settings">Game Settings</a> menu. If you would like to use a generic list of routes, select the <em>Custom</em> version in Game Settings.
        </p>

        </p>

        <!-- FAST SCORING -->
        <h1 id="fast" class="text-primary">Fast Scoring</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Fast Scoring</strong> is a feature unique to TTR Train Tracker. This feature allows you to quickly add up a player's routes without having to continuously reopen the available routes action. This is especially usefull for players who like to add up their routes at the end of the game instead of trying to keep track of them throughout the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to take advantage of <strong>Fast Scoring</strong>, simply select the user you want to calculate and select 'More Options'. From this action list click the 'Fast Scoring' link and you will be presented with a popup message allowing you to click the various route lengths. <mark>Keep in mind that Fast Scoring never utilizes routes specific to the current TTR version. It will always display route lengths from 1-9.</mark>
        </p>

        <!-- TICKETS & BONUSES -->
        <h1 id="tickets" class="text-primary">Tickets &amp; Bonuses</h1>
        <p>
          Tickets &amp; bonuses allow you to calculate all of the player's destination tickets at the end of the game. The tickets and bonuses available are dependent on the current TTR version selected in the <a href="#setting">Game Settings</a> menu. The list of destination tickets and bonuses has been painstakingly compiled but if you notice any errors, <strong>PLEASE</strong> contact us and let us know.
        </p>
        <p>
          To calculate a user's completed tickets, simply click the appropriate user then select the 'More Options' link. From here, select 'Score Routes &amp; Bonuses' to be presented a length list of available routes and bonuses. The items in this list act as a 3-way switch, allowing you to specify the following states of completion:
          <img src="img/RoutesBonuses.png" />
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Completed</strong> - Green background with a white checkmark</li>
            <li><strong>Incomplete</strong> - Red background with a white 'X'</li>
            <li><strong>Not in Hand</strong> - Grey background (Default)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <!-- CHEAT SHEETS -->
        <h1 id="cheats" class="text-primary">Cheat Sheets</h1>
        <p>
          Cheat sheets provide the user with all the information relevant to the different versions of Ticket to Ride. Now you no longer need to dig up rulebooks to look up how many trains you're supposed to start with. All of that information is available at your fingertips.
